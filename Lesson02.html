<h2>Case Study: Daniel Can Discern More Truth</h2>
<div class=casestudy>

<p><strong>Case Study Objective:</strong> <a href="#LessonOutcomes">Demonstrate the five steps of the Statistical Process.</a></p>
<hr />
<iframe class="casestudyimage" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aSDdRqQy8Pk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>After taking Israel captive, Babylon’s King Nebuchadnezzar asked his chief officer to bring Israelite children who were “well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science…to stand in the king’s palaces” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.4?lang=eng#3">(Daniel 1:4)</a>. To aid their preparation, Nebuchadnezzar planned to feed them his meat and wine for three years <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.5?lang=eng#4">(Daniel 1:5)</a>.</p>
<p>Daniel did not want to defile himself by partaking of the king’s meat and wine. He asked permission to eat pulse<sup><a href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/pulse?lang=eng&query=pulse" target=_blank>1</a></sup> and drink water instead. His supervisor, Melzar, was afraid to displease the king. He thought that after eating pulse and water, the selected Israelites would look worse than their peers, and he would be punished <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.8-10?lang=eng#7">(Daniel 1:8-10)</a>.</p>
<div id="design-the-study" class="section level3">
<h3><img src="Images/Step1.png" /> Design the Study</h3>
<div class="casestudystep">
<p>With an understanding of the background of the situation, Daniel proposed an experiment. He said,</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>“Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.12,13?lang=eng#11">(Daniel 1:12-13)</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>In short, Daniel’s implied <strong>research question</strong> can be stated as: Will those who eat pulse and drink water appear healthier than those who eat the king’s meat and drink his wine?</p>
<p>Daniel’s study, which Melzar agreed to, provides an ancient example of a <strong>designed experiment</strong> because the diet individuals were given was selected by the researchers. If the researchers had just let individuals select their diet themselves, then it would have been an <strong>observational study</strong>. While both of these are useful <a href="#outcomes">types of studies</a>, only the experiment can help determine cause and effect relationships.</p>
<p>Daniel’s experiment included two groups of people.</p>
<table style="width:83%;">
<colgroup>
<col width="41%" />
<col width="41%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Group 1: Treatment</th>
<th>Group 2: Control</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Those who had the experimental treatment of eating pulse and drinking water</td>
<td>Those who ate the standard food consisting of the king’s meat.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that if there was no <strong>control group</strong>, then there would be no way to compare the effect of the diets (the treatments). For Daniel, the control group (who ate the king’s meat and drank his wine) provided a basis for comparing the effect of the new treatment (i.e. eating pulse and drinking water.)</p>
<p>Daniel’s hypothesis is that the Israelite children who eat pulse and drink water will appear healthier in just ten days, compared to those who eat the king’s meat and drink his wine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="collect-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3><img src="Images/Step2.png" /> Collect the Data</h3>
<div class="casestudystep">
<p>When designing a study, much attention is given to the process by which data are collected. Similarly, when examining a study, it is also important to understand the data collection procedures. Typically data is collected from a <strong>sample</strong>, in other words a subset (or a portion), of a <strong>population</strong>.</p>
<p>In Daniel’s experiment, the <strong>population</strong> was all of the Israelite children that were “well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.4?lang=eng#3">(Daniel 1:4)</a>. In Daniel’s experiment, a <strong>sample</strong> of this population consisting of at least Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah was given the pulse and water to eat and drink. The remainder of the population was given the king’s meat.</p>
<p>Daniel’s study design stated that data be collected at the end of 10 days on the “countenance of the children” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.12,13?lang=eng#11">(Daniel 1:12-13)</a>. Note that the scriptures do not provide enough detail to know how the “countenance of the children” was measured. It is likely that <strong>quanititative</strong> measurements were not made, just overall impressions that were <strong>categorical</strong> in nature, like “improved” or “not improved.”</p>
<p>Whatever data Melzar officially recorded would be used to compare the appearances of two groups of people: (1) Israelites who ate pulse and drank water versus (2) Israelites who ate the king’s meat and drank his wine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="describe-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3><img src="Images/Step3.png" /> Describe the Data</h3>
<div class="casestudystep">
<p>When we describe data, we use any tools appropriate to the situation. This can include verbal descriptions of the data or <strong>statistics</strong> and graphics to help visualize and summarize the <strong>sample</strong> data. The <strong>statistics</strong> and graphics from the <strong>sample</strong> data are then used to make conclusions about the <strong>population parameters</strong> in the “Make Inference” step of the Statistical Process.</p>
<p>For Daniel’s experiment, the data are described in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.15?lang=eng#14">Daniel 1:15</a> using only words instead of graphs and statistics: “And at the end of ten days [the] countenances [of those who ate pulse] appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="make-inference" class="section level3">
<h3><img src="Images/Step4.png" /> Make Inference</h3>
<div class="casestudystep">
<p><strong>Inference</strong> is the process of using the information contained in a <em>sample</em> to make a general statement (i.e. to infer something) about the entire <em>population</em>. It applies the logic that if something is true for the sample, then it must also be true for the population. The methods we will learn in this course help us know when it is appropriate to make such a bold conclusions about the population and when it would be unwise to do so.</p>
<p>Melzar made an inference. Based on the results of the sample, he determined that (in general) those who eat pulse and drink water will be healthier than those who eat the king’s meat and drink his wine <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.15-16?lang=eng#14">(Daniel 1:15-16.)</a>. This is a bold generalization about all of the Israelite children, that was made possible through the experiment performed on Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="take-action" class="section level3">
<h3><img src="Images/Step5.png" /> Take Action</h3>
<div class="casestudystep">
<p>The goal of a statistical analysis is to determine which action to take in a particular situation. Actions can include many things: launching an internet ad campaign (or not), expressing gratitude (or not), getting vaccinated (or not), etc.</p>
<p>Melzar took action as described in <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.16?lang=eng#15">Daniel 1:16</a>: “Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave [all the Israelite children] pulse.”</p>
<p>The experiment was a success! “Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in…the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah… And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm” <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/dan/1.18-20?lang=eng#15">(Daniel 1:18-20)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Study Design</strong> - Students at a university watch to see which gender is more likely to clean up after themselves after finishing their meal in the school’s cafeteria.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong> - This is observational because the students simply observed the behavior of students eating in the cafeteria.</p>

<p><strong>Study Design</strong> - Researchers follow a group of people over a long period of time and track whether or not the individuals develop lung cancer. They also record whether or not the individual smoked or not. They use this information to determine if the risk of developing cancer is higher for those that smoke than for those that do not.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong> - This is observational because the researchers did not determine which individuals smoked and which did not smoke. They simply observed the rates of cancer for those that smoked and those that did not smoke.</p>

<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>Both observational studies and designed experiments follow the five step procedure of the Statistical Process.</p>
<p>Designed <strong>experiments</strong> are often performed by randomly assigning subjects to one of two groups, a <strong>treatment</strong> group and a <strong>control</strong> group. The experiment is conducted by applying different kinds of treatment to the subjects in each group, and comparing the results between the two groups.</p>
<p>Often, those in the treatment group receive the actual treatment. Those in the control group either do not receive the treatment or receive a different treatment. Sometimes a <strong>placebo</strong> is given to the control group, which is meant to make individuals think they are receiving the treatment when they are not. In this way researchers can determine the effect of the treatments compared to when no treatment is given.</p>

<p><strong>Categorical variables</strong> are labels and it does not make sense to do arithmetic with them. They simply categorize each observation into a distinct category.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: some variables, like shoe size, can be considered as either quantitative or categorical variables. The researcher must decide if they wish to compute the “average shoe size” or if they want to “categorize people into groups based on their shoe size.”</p>

<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>It is often impossible to conduct a census, which is an examination of the full population. Whenever a census is possible, the population parameter of interest can be known.</p>
<p>Instead, a more feasible approach is to select a sample from the population, which provides a more manageable group of items. The information gained from the sample, the sample statistic, is used to estimate the population parameter. This process of estimating the parameter from the statistic is called “making an inference,” i.e., a generalization from the sample to the population.</p>

Performed in the 1950’s, the experiment was aimed to discover a vaccine that would prevent polio. The disease had reached epidemic status in the U.S. and Europe by the 1950’s crippling on average 35,000 people a year according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/features/poliofacts/">CDC</a>.</p>
<p>The first trial of the experiment, which enrolled almost 1.1 million children in the study, ended up as a complete failure due to some serious flaws in the design. However, a second trial of the study was later implemented, which was very successful.</p>
<div id="design-the-study-1" class="section level3">
<h3><img src="Images/Step1.png" /> Design the Study</h3>
<div class="casestudystep">
<p>Jonas Salk enrolled hundreds of thousands of children in his second study. The children were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group was given the new polio vaccine. The second group was given a placebo. The placebo was an injection that looked just like the vaccine, but contained a harmless saline solution.</p>
<p>This study was double blind. Neither the children’s parents nor their doctors knew whether a particular child received the treatment or the placebo. Both parties were blinded to this information, but well informed of the details of the study prior to participating.</p>
<p>The research hypothesis of this study was that the infection rate of polio would be lower in the vaccine group than in the placebo group. If this were the case, then that would be sufficient evidence to conclude the vaccine worked.</p>
